# BlackJack
This project is an object-oriented Java implementation of the classic Blackjack (21) game. The focus of the project is on building a fully functional game engine that handles shuffling, dealing, hand evaluation, betting, and game status. A pre-built Swing-based GUI is used to interact with the engine.
